                    <h3>Rocky Point Travel - Terms & Conditions</h3>
                    <p>In addition to the the hotels we represent, all condominiums and villas are privately owned. They are essentially people's second homes. When these owners are not using their units, they entrust their property management company and travel agents (us) to rent their units. The policies below were created to preserve the rental client's experience (you) and the owner's investment. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.</p>

                    <p><b>AGE REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
                    <p>at Las Palomas, Sonoran Spa, Sonoran Sun, and Sonoran Sea, in order to preserve a family atmosphere, we DO NOT rent to single guests under the age of 25 unless accompanied by parents during the entire rental period. Please do not book a reservation on the above resorts unless you meet this criteria.  At all the other resorts for HOLIDAYS/SPRING BREAK the person responsible for making the reservation must be 21 or older and must be present the entire rental period.</p>

                    <p><b>SONORAN SKY</b></p>
                    <p>In order to preserve the space and security of each rental client, one, two and three- bedroom condominiums are allowed to have one vehicle and one parking pass.  Four bedroom condominiums are allowed two vehicles and two parking passes.  Please be cognizant of these rules when making your reservation.</p>

                    <p><b>PAYMENTS</b></p>
                    <p>Full payment is due at the time of booking through Visa or Master Card.</p>

                    <p><b>CANCELLATIONS</b></p>
                    <p>THERE IS A $150 RESERVATION CANCELLATION FEE + 15% OF THE RESERVATION TOTAL. ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS OR CHANGES ALLOWED FOR SPRING BREAK, HOLIDAYS/PEAK SEASON RESERVATIONS (NO EXCEPTIONS).  NO CANCELLATIONS OR REFUNDS FOR REGULAR RESERVATIONS 30 DAYS OR LESS DAYS FROM ARRIVAL DATE. If you cannot use your reservation, you can transfer it to someone else.  "NO-SHOWS" OR EARLY DEPARTURES WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND.  If you change a reservation for the future within the allowed window, there are no refunds, changes or cancellations allowed after the change has been made. </p>

                    <p><b>EVICTIONS</b></p>
                    <p>In order to preserve the peace and security, all properties have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY in place.  If you are evicted by security or law enforcement personnel, you will forfeit 100% of your reservation and will not receive a refund. </p>

                    <p><b>REBOOKING / CHANGE FEE </b></p>
                    <p>Rebooking / Changes can take place for a $50 change fee, as long the reservation is 10 or more days from the original arrival date and it is not a holiday/peak season reservation.  Change is allowed within the same condo/resort originally booked and for the same number of nights or more. There are no refunds from original reservation. Changes made 10 or less days from reservation arrival date are not allowed. Only one change/postponement allowed. Does not apply to holiday/peak reservations, which are non-refundable, regardless of when the reservation was made. Changes from one resort to another are not allowed. That would constitute a cancellation as every resort is independent of each other. Also, changes are only allowed within the same condo originally booked and within six (6) months from original check-in date. There are no cancellations allowed 30 or less days from arrival date or holidays/peak reservations, regardless of time. If you made a change to a reservation, the reservation will be non-refundable. HOLIDAY RESERVATIONS CAN NOT BE CANCELED OR CHANGED. </p>

                    <p><b>CHECK-IN (4:00 PM) & CHECK-OUT (11:00 AM) </b></p>
                    <p>Early check-in is not allowed, as the unit you are renting will more than likely be rented the night before your arrival and the housekeeping staff needs sufficient time to have your condo ready and clean for you.  You can ask the reception staff upon check-in but it cannot be requested. Please do not ask us to request early check-in or check-out. </p>

                    <p><b>YOU MUST MENTION YOUR CONFIRMATION NUMBER UPON CHECK-IN</b></p>

                    <p><b>BORDER CROSSING HOURS</b></p>
                    <p>Although we highly recommend driving during the day, we understand some may need to drive at night. The Lukeville/Sonoyta border opens at 6:00 AM - Midnight (both, entry into Mexico and entry into the United States). Make sure you plan ahead so that you do not encounter a closed border on the way to Rocky Point. There are no refunds for no-shows or late arrivals. Plan accordingly.</p>


                    <p>No fireworks. NO PETS of any kind/size/breed allowed (NO EXCEPTIONS). Please do not ask us to make an exception. DO NOT risk your vacation, as there will not be a refund if you break this policy.</p>

                    <p><b>OCCUPANCY  </b></p>
                    <p>Each rental is designed to sleep a specific number of people. This number is noted on your paid confirmation notice. Sofa sleepers are available on a first-come first-serve basis and cannot be guaranteed, as they are based on availability. There are extra charges for extra guests at Las Palomas and Sonoran Sea Resorts $25 for each extra person per night. EXTRA GUEST FEES WILL BE REQUESTED ON CHECK IN.</p>

                    <p><b>CHILDREN</b></p>
                    <p>Anyone 12 years of age and older is considered an adult. Children under 12, although free, still count as a person and must not exceed the occupancy limitations. Note that babies count as a person. You will lose your damage deposit and will be subject to eviction without return of your rental payment if more people are found in your rental. </p>

                    <p><b>NOISE/EVICTION </b></p>
                    <p>To preserve the peace and tranquility of other guests, excessive noise will result in loss of deposit and/or eviction. No refunds issued for evictions.  </p>

                    <p><b>EARLY DEPARTURES </b></p>
                    <p>There will be no refunds for early departures. Do not remove any items from your unit. Efforts will be made to meet special requests; however we cannot guarantee a particular unit or condo type. </p>

                    <p><b>NOT RESPONSIBLE</b></p>
                    <p>Mexico Travel Services assumes no responsibility for harm to persons or property.  Rates are subject to change without notice. Rental clients who book a reservation outside of the present year (i.e., next year) are responsible for the difference in rates, if and when the rates change. All renters must be, at least, 25 years old during Spring Break in every resort. SONORAN SEA, LAS PALOMAS AND SONORAN SUN prohibit anyone under 25 without their parents year round.  If a person under 25 makes a reservation for Spring Break or at any time at the Sonoran Spa or Sonoran Sea, there will not be a refund. Please do not try to circumvent the system by making the reservation and then saying you are not 25 expecting an exception. The resorts will not allow it. So if you are not 25 during the above period do not place a reservation.</p>

                    <p><b>POWER OUTAGES</b></p>
                    <p>NOTE: Rocky Point Travel and San Carlos Reservations (tradenames of Mexico Travel Services) or the resorts it represents cannot be responsible for the lack of electricity, due to power outages having anything to do with storms, the electrical company (CFE) or by any other means beyond our control. Nor can we be held responsible for water shortages, which occur sometimes due to the lack of water in the town of Puerto Peñasco.  There are no refunds for any of the latter.</p>

                    <p><b>GROUND FLOOR / 3-BEDROOM UNITS</b></p>
                    <p> Ground floor units and 3-bedroom units are very popular and comprise the fewest units of every resort. If requested, we will book your reservation on a ground floor, if available. Otherwise, the lowest upper floor unit will be booked. For 3-bedrooms, the same will apply (i.e., from ocean front to ocean view). No cancellations are allowed due to lack of ground floor units or 3-bedroom ocean front units if an ocean view unit was found at a lesser price. There are elevators in every resort.</p>

                    <p><b>ALL UNITS ARE INDIVIDUALLY OWNED </b></p>
                    <p>Each unit in every resort is individually owned and each owner has furnished their rental in a fashion expected to meet the general requirements of rental guests. If you stay in a rental that did not meet your requirements, please let us know. Likewise, if you enjoyed your stay and would like to request the same unit in the future, please let us know, and we will forward this information to the respective owner.</p>
