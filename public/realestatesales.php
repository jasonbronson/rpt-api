                                <p>We believe that
                                        Rocky Point is a superior investment alternative to real estate in the U.S. and
                                        elsewhere in Mexico. Gabriel Robles, a senior real estate consultant from Mexico
                                        City, who has been involved with over 27 major resort developments, has
                                        completed a study that shows Rocky Point to be in the third year of a 25 year
                                        upward real estate cycle (source: Join Us Article, January, 2005). Even though
                                        Rocky Point is still small and relatively underdeveloped, it is attracting
                                        investments at a higher rate than any other resort area in Mexico, surpassing
                                        even Cancun and Los Cabos. Long term real estate appreciation will be driven by
                                        a limited supply of beachfront property paired up against the virtually
                                        unlimited income and population growth of the southern U.S. </p>
                                <p>Rocky Point
                                        (officially Puerto Penasco, Sonora) is an extremely attractive destination for
                                        U.S. vacationers. It is the beach closest to Arizona, only 60 miles away from
                                        the U.S. border and 220 miles from central Phoenix (approximately 3.5 hour
                                        drive). It is also within comfortable driving range of California, Nevada, New
                                        Mexico and Western Texas. Rocky Point stretches along the majestic Sea of
                                        Cortez, boasts beautiful beaches, world class fishing and diving, a wealth of
                                        marine wildlife unequalled in the northern hemisphere (including sea lions,
                                        dolphins, and whales), mild year-round climate, extensive legal infrastructure
                                        to make it safe and easy for Americans to own property, practically no risk of
                                        hurricanes (unlike Florida) given that it's on a gulf protected by the Baja
                                        Peninsula, and real estate prices that are substantially lower than those found
                                        in California beachfront areas. </p>

                                        property values have risen rapidly in the recent past and have plenty of upside
                                        remaining. Mid-market condos that were sold in 1999 for USD$150,000 were re-sold
                                        for over USD$300,000 in 2004, and beachfront home lots that were sold for
                                        $140,000 in 1998 were re-sold for $600,000 in 2004 (source: Arizona Republic
                                        article Sunday, March 7, 2004). At these growth rates, a beachfront condo
                                        selling today for USD$450,000 would resell for well over USD$900,000 in 2009.
                                        This projection may seem high today but remains low relative to prices in San
                                        Diego and Los Cabos, useful comparable markets because they are also nearby
                                        Arizona and some of the other Rocky Point target markets. In San Diego, luxury
                                        beachfront condos of 2,000 to 2,500 square feet typically range from USD$1.5
                                        million to well over USD$3 million (source: Craig's List). In Los Cabos, condos
                                        found in the higher-end resort properties sell in excess of USD$1,000 per square
                                        foot (source: Bruce D. Greenberg, appointee by Governors Hull and Napolitano to
                                        aid in consumer guidelines for purchasing real estate in Sonora, Mexico).
