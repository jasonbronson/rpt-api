                    <p><b>Border Hours</b></p>
                    <p> Closed midnight to 6:00 a.m.</p>

                    <p><b>Vehicle Entry Inspections</b></p>
                    <p>Just like crossing into Mexico on foot, they employ the green-light,red-light system for random searches. When you cross into Mexico, there will often be a traffic-light signal for you to press (if on foot) or it'll activate when your car pulls through the lane. Before that, you need to select a lane, if your exemptions do not exceed the permitted limits use Nothing to Declare Lane, if you are bringing goods worth more than the personal or family exemptions or the amount exceed the allowed in your personal luggage please use the Self declaration Lane.<br>

                        If you have chosen the Nothing to Declare Lane:
                        <br>
                        Green Light indicates that you can drive through without inspection, drive right on through (Again, unless you have a truck or van or a large car and they think you may have quantities of taxable items, then they may tell you to pull over anyway!)
                        <br>
                        Red Light indicates that your luggage will be inspected. Pull your vehicle over to the parking spaces in the center for inspection of your vehicle's contents
                        <br>
                        If you mistakenly choose the wrong lane, you may approach a Customs Inspector and ask for a classification and appraisal of your goods for the corresponding payment of taxes and duties.</p>

                    <p><b>What to expect when crossing the border?</b></p>
                    <p>US Customs officer(s) may ask what you have/where you are going - Then they may pass you through, or do a quick visual search of your vehicle's passenger areas, and or trunk,etc. If you're in an RV, towing recreational vehicles, or just have a 'big' car, expect to get pulled over and given the once-over. Don't take any offense - the bigger the car, the more interesting it is, so they'll want to take a look. Some regular questions they might ask are the following: Do you have more than 10 thousand dollars in cash? Do you carry weapons or drugs?
                        <br>
                        Then again, they may take one look at you and wave you through.
                        <br>
                        MX Customs officer(s)
                        <br>
                        If you have anything over the legal import amount you will pay a fine to the bank there & will be given a receipt (The tax/fine may be from 30%+ to 2 times the item's value - they will ask for your receipts)
                        <br>
                        NOTE: If you are importing, something pull over to the left parking area. Don't go up to the light - Walk up to the tax clerks window, and you will only pay a tax of .16 (16%) times the items value (T.V., air conditioner, building supplies, etc.)
                        <br>
                        HOT TIP: Buy what you can in Sonoyta or Puerto Peñasco!
                        <br>
                        Carry all vehicle registration paperwork, or you may be turned back at the border (or may get them confiscated) by Mexican Customs (includes quads, motorcycles, dune buggies, etc.) The car's title is not necessary (a Xerox copy in your wallet wouldn't be a bad idea) but you should have proof of ownership of some sort in case it is requested.

                        Always carry Mexican auto insurance on your vehicle (Keep a copy in a safe place - away from your car). If you need to purchase Mexican car insurance before your trip, <a href="autoinsurance.php" class="bluelink">click here!</a></p>

                    <p><b>What about Pets when crossing the border?</b></p>
                    <p>PETS: (Dogs & Cats Only) Bring a valid U.S. Veterinarian Health Certificate Form and Rabies Certificate # 77043 (not more than six (6) months old).  While many people say 'we've never had a problem bringing our pet back and forth across the border', you really, really, really should get valid U.S. Veterinarian Health Certificate & Rabies Certificate - not more than six (6) months old. Any local vet should be able to provide these for you. Most border checks aren't going to give you a hard time about it -- but should they, and they have the right to do so, they can hold/quarantine your pet which is both traumatic and expensive. So get the forms!
<br>
                        Please know that fees may apply if you are bringing more that three pets into Mexico. Please do not intent to bring any dog food. It is prohibited and the Mexican Customs officer can take it from you.

                    <p><b>Firearms & Drugs </b></p>
                    <p>Firearms, illegal drugs and ammunition are NOT allowed into Mexico. Hunters may bring their firearm with the proper paperwork/clearance. Possession carries a penalty of 5 to 30 years in prison.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: What is Liability Only? </b></p>
                    <p>A: The Liability Only policy provides the minimum vehicle insurance required by the Mexican government. Included in this coverage is property damage caused by your vehicle, legal liability for injuries or death of persons not in your vehicle, and medical expenses for you or other persons in your vehicle.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: What is Legal Aid Coverage?</b></p>
                    <p>A: In Mexico, a traffic accident is considered a felony.  It is possible that you will be detained by the authorities, with your vehicle impounded, until they conclude their investigation. Legal Aid helps to prevent this.  With one phone call, an attorney will come to your assistance, and negotiate your immediate release, as well as the release of the vehicle.</p>

                    <p><b>Importing </b></p>
                    <p>You are allowed to bring in $75.00 USD per person worth of new merchandise – this does not include your personal items such as clothing, toiletries, etc. If you have new
                        <br>
                        Merchandise in excess of $75.00 per person you will need to declare your items and pay the impuestos (taxes) before crossing into Mexico. You may import up to $1,000 USD of new merchandise per vehicle without the assistance of a customs broker.
                        <br>
                        To declare items you are bringing into Mexico, turn left as you cross the border, just beyond the chain link fence. Park in the designated spot and go into the Aduana (Mexican Customs office) bbuilding in the middle of the two lanes. See Crossing the Border for more information on declaring merchandise.
                        <br>
                        If your merchandise totals more than $1,000 USD per vehicle, you will need the assistance of a customs broker. Customs Brokers are located on the Mexican side of the border. Park on the U.S. side and walk across to one of their offices.

                    <p><b>Auto permits  </b></p>
                    <p>are not required for vacation/tourist travel within the 'Free Zone' of Puerto Peñasco/Sonoyta or generally within the 'Border Zone' - usually up to 20 kilometers into Mexico.<br>
                        If you're going further into Mexico than that, however, it is a fairly lengthy process to get a permit. (See also US Consular Mexico Travel Tips under 'travel by car')
                        <br>
                        NOTE: If you encounter any problems or harassment from Mexican border officials, write down their name, badge/employee number & report it to 'The Federal Office of Investigations' at 91-800-00-148

                    <p><b>BORDER HOURS:  </b></p>
                    <p>Closed midnight to 6am. So get there with some time to spare... Note that seasonal, holiday, and/or spring break traffic can bump crossing waits into several hours. Labor disputes, trucker strikes, etc. can also snarl up the border crossings.
                        <br>
                        Re-entry:
                        <br>
                        When you re-enter, you'll be asked what you purchased - declare everything you are bringing back from Mexico. Anybody who says 'nothing' is almost automatically searched.
                        <br>
                        Searches:
                        <br>
                        Authorities have the right to search your vehicle. Don't give them a hard time. Again, if you're driving a high profile vehicle such as a van or an RV or a truck or an SUV, you are more likely to be searched.
                        <br>
                        Citizenship:
                        <br>
                        Be sure all occupants in your vehicle can prove U.S. Citizenship, or legal entry into the U.S. You are technically required to have proof of citizenship - and a US driver's license is NOT proof of citizenship. You should carry a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or a voter's registration card -- as well as a photo ID, such as your driver's license. Please review passport requirements.
                        <br>
                        Big purchases:
                        <br>
                        Have receipts for any big ticket, high dollar items.
                        <br>
                        Liquor and smokes!
                        <br>
                        You are allowed to enter free of duty any purchases with a combined value of up $400 per 30 day time period. Every visitor over 21 years old may bring into the United States, duty-free, the following:
                        <br>
                        3 liters of wine or hard liquor
                        <br>
                        200 cigarettes, OR 100 cigars (but not from Cuba), OR 3 pounds of smoking tobacco
                        <br>
                        $100 worth of gifts
                        <br>
                        ... and while we're on the subject of cigars, if U.S. Customs catches you with Cuban cigars, they're taking them. They might fine you. They're gonna yell at you, that's for sure. We hereby refer you to this site for some more info on the subject, in that site they get into the specific details of how Cuban cigars are distinguished from non-Cuban cigars. Please follow the rules, they are enforced.
                        <br>
                        Prescriptions
                        <br>
                        It is becoming more and more popular for US Citizens to buy prescription drugs in Mexico as the prices are cheaper. Canada is another popular alternative source for prescription drugs.
                        <br>
                        As a rule, you have to have a U.S. prescription for any prescription drugs you pick up in Mexico, even though you probably won't have to use said prescription to buy the drugs. Certain limitations on quantity (usually a 3 month supply) may also apply.
                        <br>
                        Even though the rules and legislation on the prescription drug situation is changing pretty frequently, U.S. Customs agents are aware of the 'good' and the 'bad' drugs out there, and will strictly enforce the current law. If you're picking up Retin-A, it probably won't be a problem. If you've got a bunch of Valium or Viagra, expect to be asked for your U.S. prescription. As they say, 'US Customs reserves the right to use its judgment in allowing the transport of prescription drugs. '
                        <br>
                        For more info, the University of Arizona Department of Pediatrics, oddly enough, has a well-written writeup that covers some of the specifics on picking up prescriptions in Mexico, and the U.S. Customs website has more up-to-date details.

                        Border Patrol Stops?
                        <br>
                        Even AFTER you've made it back through the US/Mexico border, it is not unusual to hit a US Border Patrol stop a few miles later. Different agencies, same goal, although the stop further in is usually more targeted towards illegal immigrants and narcotics/drug detection.

                    <p><b>U.S. Border Wait Times</b></p>
                    <p>It is highly recommended you check the border wait times prior to your departure; especially during holiday weekends. Most resorts have a check-out time of 11:00 AM which is when most travelers head to the border. Beat the traffic and the long border wait times by being aware of this. Staying an extra night is always a great idea.

                    <p><b>Q: How much does Mexican insurance cost? </b></p>
                    <p>A: There are many factors to determine the total cost of insurance. Basically it is a "sliding scale" It all depends on how much you insure you vehicle(s) for, and how long you will be insured for. Most policies are written on a daily rate. It may be less money if you are going to be traveling many days in Mexico, or are planning to return, consider a six month or an annual policy. 10% Mexican government tax on the premium  </p>

                    <p><b>Do I need permits, Visas or a passport to enter Rocky Point, and to go back to the USA? (THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR QUESTION). </b></p>

                        <p>Absolutely, it's Mexican law! This topic is discussed, in detail, below. You can purchase your policy here.</p>

                        <p><b>What do I need to bring for my vacation?</b></p>
                        <p>You will need your own beach towels, beach chairs, sunscreen, coffee, coolers, camera/film, charcoal, Frisbee, food.</p>

                        <p><b>Do you provide sheets and towels?</b></p>

                        <p>Please contact the respective resort representative for more information.</p>

                        <p><b>What if we have car trouble on the highway?</b></p>
                        <p>Mexico has traveling mechanics called "Angeles Verdes" (Green Angels) that will help motorists in distress. They drive green and white pickup trucks.  The road leading to Rocky Point is very safe. From the border to Rocky Point is only one hour away (60 miles).</p>

                        <p><b> Is Rocky Point safe?</b></p>
                        <p>Rocky Point is very safe. The locals depend on tourism to survive; which is their primary source of revenue. At the same time, use your common sense and judgment. Respect the local customs and culture. Remember, you are only driving one hour inside of Mexico from the U.S. border.  In Rocky Point, life runs slower than some of us are used to in the United States and sometimes tourists become impatient with the slow traffic.  Be cognizant of the local customs and culture (...when in Rome).  Besides, shouldn't you slow down while enjoying yourself here?</p>

                        <p><b> Do you allow pets or fireworks?</b></p>
                        <p>Absolutely no pets of any kind, breed or size.  We get this question quite frequently and cannot make an exception. We are obligated to enforce the rules and regulations, per the the owners of the resorts we represent. You may see people walking their dogs. That is because those are owners, not renters.  Any renter found with a pet will be evicted, will not receive a refund and will forfeit their entire security deposit. If you are found using fireworks you will be evicted without a refund as well.</p>

                        <p><b>Do you have occupancy limitations in your units?</b></p>
                        <p>Absolutely!  All units have occupancy limitations (check on the "rates" section for more information). If you are found to have more people than it is recorded on your reservation, or exceed the occupancy limitations, you will be evicted without a refund.  Even though children under are free, they are still considered as an occupant.  Please be cognizant of the exact guest count before you book your reservation. Don't jeopardize your vacation by exceeding occupancy limitations or not reporting the number of occupants. You will be issued a wristband. The number of wristbands (which allow you to be at the resort) will be issued to the number reported on your reservation - no exceptions. Some resorts will charge you and some delegate us to do so.</p>

                        <p><b> How far are the resorts from town?</b></p>
                        <p>The town of Puerto Peñasco, with its restaurants, gift shops and bars is only 5-7 minutes away from the Sandy Beach area. Peñasco del Sol Hotel and Pinacate Resort are right in the center of town. </p>

                        <p><b>Can I barbecue inside the condo?</b></p>
                        <p>No. It is a fire hazard and prohibited.  However, there are BBQs throughout the common areas in every resort. You would have to bring your own cooking materials (i.e., charcoal, lighter fluid, etc).</p>

                        <p><b>Can we use another resort's facilities while we're staying at a different one?</b></p>
                        <p>No. Each resort is independent from the other. You can only use the facilities of the resort you are staying at. However, you can use any public establishment, no matter where you are staying at.  For example, you can dine at the Sonoran Grill (located at the Sonoran Spa) or you can visit La Spa de Penasco (i.e., for massages, facials, pedicures, etc.) at the Sonoran Spa, Las Palomas restaurants, etc..</p>

                        <p><b> Do you provide a list of amenities for each resort?</b></p>
                        <p>Absolutely. Click Here.</p>

                        <p><b> Will I be able to spot dolphins?</b></p>
                        <p>More than likely you will.  Periodically, schools of dolphins swim across the Sea of Cortez and even whales can be observed in the area. Want to get even closer? Take a boat trip.</p>

                        <p><b> Any information on Souvenirs or Gift Shops?</b></p>
                        <p>Well, you can't leave Rocky Point without taking a piece of memorabilia.  There are plenty of gift shops to satisfy the most discriminating taste and budget. However, for the price and variety, we recommend that you stop at our favorite area.  This area is known by different names: 1. Choya Mall; 2. Rodeo Drive or 3. Our favorite name of all:  Shacks 5th Ave.  The nicer the store, the more you will pay. And remember, CASH IS KING!</p>

                        <p><b> How about the restaurants?</b></p>
                        <p>There are plenty of restaurants in town to choose from.  We truly enjoy the following ones.:
<br>
                            1. Hacienda Las Fuentes - This is Rocky Point's newest and nicest restaurant. The restaurant's atmosphere is everything you expect from a nice Mexican restaurant and more. The food is outstanding and the selection of drinks is enormous. It is located on the way to the Las Conchas development.
                            <br>
                            2. Casa del Capitan - sits on top of a hill and overlooks the Sea of Cortez.  Offers exquisite food and a magnificent and unparalleled view.
                            <br>
                            3. Fish - This one sits on top of the hill also; right next to Rocky Point's lighthouse. Great food, live music and even dancing.
                            <br>
                            4. Friendly Dolphin - A great place to take friends and family also. The decorations are impressive and the atmosphere is fun fun! Don't be surprised if Gast?, the owner, sits down to chat and sing for you.  Take a look at all the celebrity pictures on the walls. If he does, tell him Rocky Point Travel sent you.
                            <br>
                            5. La Curva - This restaurant is not famous for its looks but for its exquisite food and family atmosphere. It is a family restaurant that has satisfied the locals' palates for decades and now it's becoming a favorite stop for our rental clients.</p>

                        <p><b> Can I buy property in Rocky Point?</b></p>
                        <p>Yes you can. Interested in buying a piece of paradise? CLICK HERE.</p>

                        <p><b> How much alcohol & shrimp can we bring back to the U.S.?</b></p>
                        <p>1 liter of Alcohol per adult or 5 kilos of fish or shrimp.</p>

                        <p><b> Are there delays crossing the border?</b></p>
                        <p>Transiting the international border at the crossing in Lukeville, Arizona, which is the one you will be using if you are driving down from the direction of either Phoenix or Tucson, normally takes less than a minute in either direction. There are often delays on Sunday afternoons, due to lots of people heading back north at the same time. Of course you could always stay an extra night and head back north on Monday, thereby avoiding any traffic. If you will have internet access, here is a great link provided by US Customs. Just scroll down and find LUKEVILLE. There, you will see the wait times (live / 10-minute delay). CLICK HERE.</p>

                        <p><b> Can I take a rental car into Mexico?</b></p>
                        <p>It's not an issue with the Mexican authorities, as long as you have a valid rental agreement in your possession, should they happen to check (unlikely).  The only company we are aware of that allows you to take their vehicles into Mexico is Enterprise Rent-A-Car, provided you purchase Mexican insurance, which you would need in any case.  Other smaller and independent companies may allow it as well.  We have heard that Dollar is also allowing their cars be taken into Mexico. Check with your company of choice</p>

                        <p><b>Do we bring Cash or Credit Cards?</b></p>
                        <p>Dollars are universally accepted in Rocky Point and there is not even a need to take pesos or exchange dollars into pesos while you are visiting Rocky Point. The ubiquitous Visa and MasterCard are accepted in most places, although not usually in the smaller cafes and shops. There are ATM machines at all four banks in town, so you can always replenish your cash supply that way.  You will receive Mexican Pesos only. The current exchange is around 10 to 1 (pesos to dollars).  By the way - you always have more bargaining power when using CA$H.</p>

                        <p><b> Can I drink the water?</b></p>
                        <p>You can, but pretty much everyone drinks bottled water, just to be sure. Besides, the local water has a high mineral content and doesn't really taste very good.  We provide A 5-gallon bottle of purified water in all our rental units. You may want to bring smaller bottles to take with you, as you tour Rocky Point. It is only a myth that people get sick by drinking or eating in Mexico. If that were the case, there wouldn't be a restaurant standing. All restaurants cook with purified water. In most instances, people who get sick are dehydrated or consumed too much alcohol. This can happen anywhere in the world.</p>

                        <p><b> Can I use my cell phone?</b></p>
                        <p>Maybe. The best way to find out is by contacting your carrier and asking them if they provide service in Rocky Point. Some carriers offer the roaming service automatically and some need to be notified so that they can activate the service for you. In a worst case scenario, you can buy telephone cards to be used in many payphones.  They can be purchased at convenience and drug stores.</p>

                        <p><b> On the Road in Mexico</b></p>
                        <p>Some common signs and their meanings:

                            * Curva - Curve

                            * Llanteros - Tire repair shop

                            * Alto - You will see that in all Stop signs and means that, Stop.

                            * Topes - Speed bumps</p>

                        <p><b>Fishing in Rocky Point</b></p>
                        <p>Fishing permits are required for everyone in any boat where even one person is fishing. Exception: those under 12 do not need a permit if accompanied by an adult permitted fisherman. Catches can not be sold or exchanged and each person can only take 11 pounds of fish from Mexico per trip. All boats in Mexican waters need a valid permit. Grouper, Pinto Bass, Red Snapper and Yellowtail are fish that are available in December. Grouper can go up to 200 lbs; their white meat is very tasty and is prepared by baking, frying and grilling. They like to hid in rock piles below cliffs and underwater reefs. Yellowtail range up to 20 lb s and spawn in the Sea of Cortez. They prefer warm waters and migrate northward to feed as the waters warm up. Once abundant, Yellowtail were almost destroyed by over fishing.

                        <p><b>Do I need Mexican insurance?</b></p>
                        <p>In a word, yes! While some American insurance companies will cover you a certain limited distance inside Mexico, the Mexican government does not recognize any American insurance as valid. In case of a fender bender, you may have to establish your ability to pay for the damage (meaning Mexican insurance or cash), whether its your fault or not, so its best to be prepared, meaning insured. When purchasing ask to be given the name and phone number of the local adjuster at your destination, just in case. The adjuster will handle any negotiations and arrange for whatever needs to be done, in the event of a problem, so if that's not forthcoming, buy somewhere else. The cost depends on the value of your vehicle and length of your stay. You can buy it at the border, or you can buy it from the comfort of your own home through us by clicking below:

                            Everyone asks the same question. Why buy from Mexico Travel Services?
                            <br>

                        <p><b>Q: Why do I need Mexican insurance? </b></p>
                        <p>A: Mexico has traffic laws very similar to the United States. The application of their laws is what accounts for the differences, and the reasons for needing Mexican insurance. The law in Mexico is based on the Napoleonic Code where guilt prevails over the assumption of innocence. In the U.S., the law is based on the English Common Law where innocence prevails over the assumption of guilt. Mexico does not have compulsory automobile insurance. The basic difference between Mexico's and United States financial responsibility law is that anyone involved in an accident in Mexico must have the means to respond to damages or injuries for which they may be responsible....which in Mexico would be in the form of either cash or a Mexican insurance policy.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: Do I need a Mexico Car Permit?</b></p>
                        <p>A: If you plan on only driving in the state of Sonora, the answer is NO, you don't need a permit.. If you plan to drive outside the state of Sonora in mainland Mexico beyond the border areas, or plan to transport a vehicle by ferry from Baja California to mainland Mexico, then yes, you do need a permit.. Permits are also not required for travel on the Baja California peninsula.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: Does my U.S. insurance policy cover me in Mexico?</b></p>
                        <p>A: Some policies may cover your vehicle for physical damage. The problem is that the Mexican government does not recognize any policies as valid unless it is by a Mexican Insurance Company. You must have a Mexican Insurance Policy that covers you for your liability in Mexico.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: How is the value of my vehicle determined?</b></p>
                        <p>A: Your insurance agent should be able to help you, or you can click on the above banner, which has a Kelly's Blue Book link and check for yourself to determine your vehicle's value. Make sure to add those extras you want insured in case you should have a loss. Don't forget to add the vehicle being towed, if any, in the amount to be insured. We advise you not to under-insure.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: What if I have a loan on my vehicle?</b></p>
                        <p>A: Most lenders will require that they be furnished a copy of your policy indicating that the unit is insured while it is in Mexico. Just include the "lien holder" on your policy. Always make sure you allow enough time before your trip into Mexico to allow for the handling of paperwork.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: If I tow a trailer, boat, or another vehicle, do I need to insure them?</b></p>
                        <p>A: No, and it must be listed on the policy with the towing vehicle, otherwise the towing vehicle's insurance could be voided in the event of an accident or loss. If you are towing another Car or Truck, and plan on driving it around in Mexico, you will need a policy to cover it for driving and not just while it is in tow.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: If I am borrowing a vehicle, will I need any special documents?</b></p>
                        <p>A: Yes, you should obtain a notarized affidavit of permission from the legal owner?</p>

                        <p><b>Q: What is Liability Only?</b></p>
                        <p>A: The Liability Only policy provides the minimum vehicle insurance required by the Mexican government. Included in this coverage is property damage caused by your vehicle, legal liability for injuries or death of persons not in your vehicle, and medical expenses for you or other persons in your vehicle.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: What is Legal Aid Coverage?</b></p>
                        <p>A: In Mexico, a traffic accident is considered a felony, it is possible that you will be detained by the authorities, with your vehicle impounded, until they conclude their investigation. Legal Aid helps prevent this, with one phone call an attorney will come to your assistance, and negotiate your immediate release, as well as the release of the vehicle.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: What's covered on a Mexican auto insurance policy? </b></p>
                        <p>A: Contrary to the more broad coverage's of a standard U.S. auto policy, a Mexican tourist auto policy is a named peril policy. Basically that means, "what you see is what you get". If it is not listed on the Policy Coverage then it is not a part of the coverage, nothing more and nothing less.<br>
                            There are five (5) basic risks to a standard Mexican tourist auto policy. <br>
                            1) Collision, Upset, and Glass Breakage<br>
                            2) Fire and Total Theft<br>
                            3) Property Damage Liability<br>
                            4) Bodily Injury Liability<br>
                            5) Medical Expenses<br>
                            There are various methods of customizing a Mexican tourist policy. You are encouraged to clearly define your travel plans to your Mexican insurance agent so that adequate insurance is established. </p>

                        <p><b>Q: What's NOT covered on a Mexican auto insurance policy? </b></p>
                        <p>A: As important as it is to know what is covered, it is worthwhile to also know what is NOT covered. Some of the losses and/or expenses an insured might incur which are not covered include pilferage, vandalism, lodging expenses, toll calls, and loss of wages. </p>

                        <p><b>Q: Are claims paid in dollars?  </b></p>
                        <p>A: The Mexican insurance company settles all insurance claims in U.S. dollars from their claims offices in Mexico. </p>

                        <p><b>Q: How much does Mexican insurance cost?</b></p>
                        <p>A: There are many factors to determine the total cost of insurance. Basically it is a "sliding scale" It all depends on how much you insure you vehicle(s) for, and how long you will be insured for. Most policies are written on a daily rate. It may be less money if you are going to be traveling many days in Mexico, to go with an annual policy (covers you for the entire year).
                            . 10% Mexican government tax on the premium </p>

                        <p><b>Q: Do I have to go to your office to get my insurance policy? </b></p>
                        <p>A: No. Click on the banner above and start the process. It is easy.  Stopping at the border to get insurance can be timely and expensive.  Doing it from the comfort of your own home, printing the policy from your own computer, is another benefit of renting your condo through us.

                        <p><b>How's the weather? </b></p>
                        <p>The best The sun shines almost year round in Rocky Point. The weather is one of the main reasons people visit Rocky Point. Rocky Point experiences only 2 inches of rain a year so a dry trip with plenty of sunshine is pretty much guaranteed. For most of the year the days are sunny and warm. During the winter months the days are warm although the nights can get a bit chilly. The summer months, especially June through September, can be warm because of the 90-degree plus temperatures combine with high humidity. However, because the water temperature is above 80 degrees and there is almost always an ocean breeze to produce pleasant evenings, some people find this time of the year to be their favorite.
