                    <h3>Fractionals - Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                    <p align="left"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc; font-size: medium;">Fractional Ownership </span> </strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: small;">In a nutshell, the concept of fractional (shared) ownership is to divide the purchase cost and maintenance of a property into segments which match the amount of time an owner desires each year at the home. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Maintenance and schedule coordination are provided by a management company. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Owning your own vacation home has never been easier!</span></p>
                    <p><strong><span style="color: #0099cc; font-size: small;">Benefits of Fractional Ownership:</span></strong></p>
                    <p><u><span style="font-size: small;">Pay only for what you use</span></u><span style="font-size: small;">. Instead of paying $2M for a home used occasionally, you can buy ownership shares for the amount of vacation time you want. Purchase 10% (5 weeks per year) or 20% (10 weeks) in a deeded fee simple share.</span></p>
                    <p><u><span style="font-size: small;">Expenses are shared amongst owners</span></u><span style="font-size: small;"> (taxes, insurance, utilities, etc).</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">1.&nbsp; What are fractionals and are they the same thing as private residence clubs?</span><br /> </strong>Fractional ownership of condos and vacation homes, also called private residence clubs, allows you to enjoy up to three months of home ownership privileges at a top-of-the-line, luxury resort but at a fraction of the cost of whole ownership.&nbsp; </span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">2.&nbsp; Who are fractionals really for?</span><br /> </strong>This type of real estate arrangement is ideal if you want the benefits of owning an impressive second home located in a very exclusive community but can't justify the investment because of limited use.</span></p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="/img/bed-stock.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" border="0" /></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">3.&nbsp; How long is a typical fractional share?</span></strong><br /> Traditionally, each property is divided between four (most common) or eight owners.&nbsp; The calendar year is divided between the owners and rotated accordingly.&nbsp; </span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;">Because there are far fewer owners of each individual property than say your typical timeshare, you'll have a lot more options regarding when you can use the home.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">4.&nbsp; Where are some of the services I might expect from a fractional ownership or private residence club?</span><br /> </strong>You will receive the same services individual owners receive at the resort/development for you wish to purchase.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">5.&nbsp; Where are fractionals located?</span></strong><br /> Fractionals or residence clubs have sprung up in exclusive, world-class resort <img src="/img/beach-chair-stock.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="375" align="left" border="1" hspace="10" vspace="5" />destinations worldwide.&nbsp; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Puerto Vallarta,&nbsp;Mexico are popular locations.&nbsp; In the U.S., the first fractionals were in major ski areas out west, particularly Colorado.&nbsp; Eventually they spread to northeastern ski areas.&nbsp; </span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;">Since then fractionals have begun appearing in golf-oriented communities like Hilton Head Island, South Carolina and popular beach states like Florida.&nbsp; </span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">6.&nbsp; Who manages the fractionals?</span><br /> </strong>Every resort is managed by a professional property management company.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">7.&nbsp; How do fractionals differ from time shares?</span><br /> </strong>Fractionals are far more exclusive and include many more luxury amenities and services than timeshares.&nbsp; They tend to be larger homes, usually two to five bedrooms. Timeshares are typically for one to two weeks per year.&nbsp; Fractionals typically offer 6 - 12 weeks, depending on the number of owners. </span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;">Financing a fractional with a bank or mortgage company loan is easier than financing a timeshare.&nbsp; That's because timeshares are looked upon as assets that depreciate while fractionals are considered appreciating assets.&nbsp; Most lenders treat the purchase of fractionals like they would wholly-owned second homes.&nbsp; However, in Mexico, typically most transactions are consummated via cash or seller financing.&nbsp; This could vary per transaction.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;">Finally, there are a limited number of fractionals on the market, unlike timeshares which are more common.&nbsp; Most likely the quantity of fractionals will stay small because of the emphasis placed on building in only the very best, most highly desirable locations.&nbsp; The result is that demand outpaces supply, resulting in appreciation and good resale potential, neither of which timeshares can offer.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">8.&nbsp; How do fractionals differ from condo hotels?</span><br /> </strong>Both offer luxurious accommodations and services for the person seeking a vacation home.&nbsp; The condo hotel, however tends to be an individual room or suite located within a major hotel.&nbsp; Fractionals can be condos, townhouses, or single-family homes located in an exclusive community.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">9.&nbsp; Why should I buy a fractional instead of a wholly-owned second home?</span></strong><br /> Most people who buy a fractional recognize that they won't be spending more than a couple of months a year at their vacation home.&nbsp; With a fractional you can get the quality and level of luxury you want and only pay for the "fraction" of time you actually plan to use the home.&nbsp; And you never have to be concerned with finding renters for the months you're not there.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;">Also, keep in mind that included in the sale price and annual fees of a fractional is all your maintenance, upkeep and housekeeping.&nbsp; Fractionals are 100% hassle free!</span></p>

                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">10. Can you trade or rent out your time?</span><br /> </strong>In most cases, yes, but you'll, of course, want to check the specific guidelines for the property you're considering.&nbsp; Most fractionals also participate in a reciprocal usage program similar to timeshares in which you can trade weeks and locations.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0099cc;">11.&nbsp; Can more than one individual or family own a residence interest?</span><br /> </strong>At most properties, the answer is yes.&nbsp; In addition, the extended family of the owner including children, grandchildren, siblings and parents can use the residence and are entitled to the membership privileges.</span></p>
