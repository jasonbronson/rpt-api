                Our stay at this property was wonderful! The kitchen was spacious and had all the necessary items for cooking. The property was beautiful and private. The property was well maintained with spacious bathrooms and bedrooms. The beds were comfortable. The beach was a short walk but the private patio was perfect for sitting outside and reading or enjoying the sun. We highly recommend this property for your Rocky Point vacation!

                We enjoyed our stay at this wonderfully appointed villa. The owner was very professional throughout the rental process. The villa was very clean and conveniently located in the ground floor close the pool and the beach. We look forwarding renting this villa again.
